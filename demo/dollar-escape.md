# Dollar Escape

Plain math:

$E = mc^2$

Escaped dollars:

\$5 should render as $5.

this is a $100 phone
this is a \$100 phone
this is a $100-$200 phone
this is a \$100-\$200 phone

\\$ should render as \\$.

\\\$ should render as \\\$.

Inline code should stay literal: `\$` and `\\$`.

Fenced code should stay literal:

```
$E = mc^2$
\$5
\\$
\\\$
```
